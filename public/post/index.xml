      <title>Austrian Parliament: MPs transparency and conflict of interest report</title>

      <description>ContextRecently, at the end of June, the Austrian Parliament published its annual report on MPs’ additional sources of revenue and pertaining activities (see here). The publication is mandatory by law, and basically seeks to curtail potential conflicts of interest and to increase transparency as to MPs’ activities outside of parliament. While the list comes, unsurprisingly, with a number of caveats 1, and by itself can hardly constitute a watertight safeguard against the various ‘undemocratic temptations’, the report nevertheless seems to provide interesting data on MPs’ financial statuses and professional machinations.</description>

CONTEXTThis blog post has been lingering for a few months now in my draft folder and for no other tangible reason than the Covid19 mayhem, I have no excuse for not having posted it much earlier. In short, the blog is a continuation of the analysis of voting behavior in Bosnia’s parliament during the 2014 to 2018 legislative period.</description>

      <title>Update on Google mobility reports on Austria</title>

      <description>ContextThis is a short update on my previous post dealing with Google’s mobility reports on Austria. Since the last post was published, the (at least preliminary) peak of the epidemic has passed, restrictions are lifted one after the other , and the country is gradually ‘re-booted’. Against this background, I thought it might be instructive to see how this is reflected in Google’s mobility reports.
To recap, Google’s mobility reports present data on the change of numbers of individuals staying at particular types of places (e.</description>

      <title>Google&#39;s Mobility reports: changes to mobility patterns during Covid-19 lock-down in Austria</title>

      <description>CONTEXTHere’s a quick post related to Covid-19, but don’t be afraid, it won’t be another infection et al visualization (see here, but also here). Google and Apple recently released mobility reports which provide some insights on how the lockdown to curtail the epidemic’s spread affected individuals’ mobility patterns. While Apple’s reports draw on to routing requests to its Apple Map service, Google’s mobility reports highlight how people’s (= mobile device owner who activated their geo-location) presence on specific type of places changed relatively to a baseline period preceding the outbreak of the crisis and the introduction of the lockdown.</description>

      <description>Graphs updated on Thursday, 23 Apr 2020
With the COVID epidemic taking a pretty firm grip on our lives, I thought I’ll use this post as a kind of analytic repository regarding the developments in Austria. There are certainly plenty of other, more advanced analyses out there, so see this as a kind of personal attempt to get a grip on the virus and what is happening around us.</description>

      <title>Segregation in Vienna&#39;s primary schools?</title>

      <description>ContextOur daughter will turn six this summer and in Austria this means that she will start attending school in autumn. While in most parts of Austria’s countryside it’s a rather foregone conclusion to which school a new pupil will go (since there is mostly only one school ‘in town’), choosing a school for your kid in a city like Vienna can become a somewhat protracted decision making process with numerous schools in the vicinity to select from.</description>

      <title>Bosnia: Voting behavior of MPs in the House of Representatives</title>

      <description>CONTEXTA while ago I noticed that the website of Bosnia’s parliament also provides the voting records for each separate vote taken in both houses. These records also include the voting behavior for each individual MP. Here an example of one of these voting records:
While the dominant role of the ethnic cleavage in Bosnian politics has been a constant theme and continuously emphasized for the last 25 years (to an extent which frequently blanks out other salient issues), I hadn’t seen any empirical record on MP’s individual voting behavior which could corroborate the cleavage’s prevalence in the legislative arena (one insightful exception is Birgit Bahtić-Kunrath’s 2011 paper).</description>

      <description>Entity vetoArticle IV 3(d)

      <title>Austrian General Elections 2019: Preference votes</title>

      <description>ContextOn 29 September, Austria held its general elections to the national assembly (Nationalrat). By now a flurry of analyses and comments has been published and the caravan of political commentary has largely moved on, at least when it comes to the analysis of the results itself (the government formation train is finally also getting up to speed). One aspect, I personally have never looked into, and which seems to fall a bit under the radar, is the use of preference votes by Austria’s electorate.</description>

      <description>ContextSo, Austria has a new parliament. Following the elections in September, the new lower house got constituted yesterday and as a few noted it is more diverse than previous ones. Here’s a nice visualization if you want to get a quick overview. Among others, it was the share of women in parliament which was particularly often noted. None of Austria’s previous lower houses had an as high share of women at the start of a new legislative period.</description>
