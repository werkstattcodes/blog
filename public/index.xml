      <description>ContextOn 29 September, Austria held its general elections to the national assembly (Nationalrat). By now a flurry of analyses and comments has been published and the caravan of political commentary has largely moved on, at least when it comes to the analysis of the results itself (the government formation train is finally also getting up to speed). One aspect, I personally have never looked into, and which seems to fall a bit under the radar, is the use of preference votes by Austria’s electorate.</description>

      <title>BiH: Voting behavior of MPs in House of Representatives</title>

      <description>ContextA while ago I noticed that the website of Bosnia’s parliament now also provides the voting records for each separate vote taken in both houses. These records also include the voting behavior for each individual MP. While the dominant role of the ethnic cleavage in Bosnian politics has been a constant theme and continuously emphasized for the last 25 years (to an extent which frequently blanks out other salient issues), I hadn’t seen any empirical record on MP’s voting behavior which could cooroberate the cleavage’s prevalence in the legislative arena (one insightful exception is Birgit Kunrath’s 2011 paper).</description>

      <title>Potential sizing issue when importing interactive plots (ggraph; htmlWidget)</title>

      <description>This post documents a potential issue when it comes to sizing interactive images/htmlwidgets produced with the ggiraph and htmlwidgets packages. The goal is to import interactive graphs produced in other R(Studio) Projects into a blogdown post. I assume/hope there there is a relatively easy solution to it, but I haven’t yet figured it out.
Create interactive plotFirst, let’s create an interactive plot. Here it has the dimensions 10 by 5 inches and is meant to have no padding.</description>

      <description>ContextSo, Austria has a new parliament. Following the elections in September, the new lower house got constituted yesterday and as a few noted it is more diverse than previous ones. Here’s a nice visualization if you want to get a quick overview. Among others, it was the share of women in parliament which was particularly often noted. None of Austria’s previous lower houses had an as high share of women at the start of a new legislative period.</description>

      <description>Not that the world would have been waiting for another blog&amp;hellip; but there you go. This (work in progress?) blog is a collection of my &amp;lsquo;thoughts in R&amp;rsquo; with varying degrees of seriousness. Posts will mostly relate to my substantive interests (comparative political science, human rights) or are simply notes to myself on a specific R function. Not claiming any final truth. One step at a time.
