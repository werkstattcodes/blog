# About

Not that the world would have been waiting for another blog... but there you go. This (work in progress?) blog is a collection of my 'thoughts in R' with varying degrees of seriousness. Posts will mostly relate to my substantive interests (comparative political science, human rights) or are simply notes to myself on a specific R function. Not claiming any final truth. One step at a time. 

Codes are collected at [www.github.com/zoowalk](https://www.github.com/zoowalk)<br>

## Site
The site is run with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The theme is based on [Stephen Siegers](https://www.xiegerts.com/) (@siegerts) elegant [Theme Basic](https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic). 

## Data protection
Note that since I like to click on my own site and see how the the hit statistic increases, the site runs a google analytics script and tracks visitors.
