<p>Not that the world would have been waiting for another blog… but there you go. Here I collect my ramblings and ‘notes to my self’ in R. Posts either have a substantive focus or simply seek to highlight some R feature. No pretension to have the final word let alone sole truth on anything put out here.</p>
<p>Codes are collected at www.github.com/zoowalk
Tweets are at <span class="citation">@zoowalk</span></p>
